== Description ==
ClickMeter Link Shortener and Analytics‏ is dedicated to marketing Agencies, Affiliates, Publishers and Advertisers. This powerful all-in-one plugin allows you to immediately optimize your web-marketing actions:

- <strong>Custom Domain link shortner</strong>:
Short every link, inside and outside your WordPress site, using your own domain name (as opposed to using tinyurl.com, goo.gl, bit.ly, or any other link shortner service!). Using a dedicated domain, short url will increase your brand awareness, will show a short url than does not look spammy, will not be blacklisted. 

- <strong>Advanced url redirect</strong>:
Using the advanced redirection options you will be able to redirect users where they yield best conversion rates, will be able to protect your affiliate codes and create safe links for SEO.

- <strong>Actionable analytics</strong>:
Understand which of your posts or pages is the most viewed, which leads the most valuable conversions and why. You will be able to see all results in one easy-to read page or drill-down to every single click or conversion. 

- <strong>Link Monitor</strong>:
Discover broken links and redirect them to a custom page, detect click fraud activities, blacklisted landing pages and other wrong server activities.

This Wordpress plugin is powerful and extremely scalable because it is based on ClickMeter Engines API and database clusters so it will not load your WP database and server. You will be able to create as many links and track as many posts and pages as you need.
